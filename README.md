# Sendit Android App
An android app source code to demo my latest practises in Android & Kotlin world.


## Getting started
In order to try the application from source code you'll need
- An instance of the server code.
- And a _local.properties_ with some credentials. 
Instead you can install it from [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.siamak.sendit&hl=en&gl=US](Google Play).
